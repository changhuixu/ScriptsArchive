## Demo E-commerce Sites

Of all the websites that need to be high quality, e-commerce sites are at the top of the list. Broken cart functionality, slow loading times, and poor UX are all web quality issues that could be avoided with the right [e-commerce software testing](https://abstracta.us/industries/ecommerce) plan.

Here are some demo e-commerce sites to test on:

- Demoblaze

  [Demoblaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/) is an example e-commerce system provided by [BlazeMeter](http://blazemeter.com/) to practice automating using JMeter, running it with Blazemeter. It even includes a section with a video so you can test [the HLS protocol](https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/how-to-run-video-streaming-performance-tests-on-hls/).

- OpenCart

  At Abstracta, we conduct several training sessions and also offer online [software testing courses](http://abstracta.academy/). For our courses, we install a version of the opensource e-commerce system called [OpenCart](https://www.opencart.com/).

- WPmobilepack

  [WPmobilepack](https://pwa-woo.wpmobilepack.com/#/) is a very simple e-commerce system, great for testing.

- Juice-Shop

  [Juice-shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) is a famous site used to test security vulnerabilities.

- 2Checkout

  [2checkout's Sandbox system](https://knowledgecenter.2checkout.com/API-Integration/Transition_guides/Transition_Guide_for_2Checkout_Sandbox) is not only an e-commerce system for customers, but you can also play with other features in the admin backend including reports, sales management, etc.

## Example Systems

- DBank Demo

  [Here](http://dbankdemo.com/login) you'll find an example of an online banking system with which you can practice tests.

- OrangeHRM

  [OrangeHRM](https://orangehrm-demo-6x.orangehrmlive.com/) is an open source product for human resource management, which has a demo site that serves very well for practicing testing a real system.

- Computer-Database

  This is a [test site](https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers) provided by [Gatling](https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/gatling-tool-review-performance-tests-written-scala/) (a tool for performance testing). It's a site with a computer database where there's a list with several columns and a search filter.

- JPetStore Demo

  [JPetStore](https://petstore.octoperf.com/actions/Catalog.action) is a test system provided by [Octoperf](https://octoperf.com/) (another tool for performance testing). As the name would suggest, it's a fake pet store with different listings, filters, etc.

## Demo Sites for Trying Web Test Automation Tools

When it comes to [software test automation](https://abstracta.us/solutions/test-automation), there are a myriad of tools and frameworks you can choose from. Whichever tools you are testing or however skilled you may be in test automation, these demo sites will come in handy for practice!

- DemoQA

  [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) contains many of the elements that are typical of most websites and it's well oriented to practicing test automation, to be able to see how to approach each of the particular things that one can find, as elements of a list that are ordered with drag and drop, inputs of different formats, etc.

- SwagLabs

  This is one more [demo web](https://www.saucedemo.com/) storefront useful for testing login and shopping cart flows. A key point about this one is that it has 4 different logins you can use for different experiences for the same site; normal, locked out, problem user, and performance glitch user.

- Selenium Easy

  [Selenium Easy](https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/bootstrap-alert-messages-demo.html) is similar to DemoQA, except it's provided by [Smartbear CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/).

## Test Pages for Automating

Along with DemoQA and Selenium Easy, [check out this resource](https://testpages.herokuapp.com/styled/index.html) which is full of example pages you can use by [Alan Richardson](https://abstracta.us/blog/podcast/quality-sense-podcast-alan-richardson/), aka "Evil Tester," for automated checks.

- The-Internet

  Dave Haeffner, creator of [Elemental Selenium](http://elementalselenium.com/), offers [this site](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/) as well to test different things like drop-down menus, hovers, etc.

- UI Test Automation Playground

  [This site](http://uitestingplayground.com/) might be smaller than the others, but it contains edge cases for load delays, mouse over behavior, dynamic IDs, and automation issues arising from hidden layers.

- Basic Calculator

  [This page](https://testsheepnz.github.io/BasicCalculator.html) provides an object with basic functionality for you to try your first attempt to use Selenium on, provided by [Mike Talks](https://twitter.com/TestSheepNZ).

- The Automation Practice â€“ clothing store

  [This page](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) is a shopping/clothing storefront example maintained by the Selenium guys. This site is perfect for multi-page testing, category filtering, and shopping cart testing scenarios.

## Sites for Trying Service Level Testing Tools (API, SOAP, REST)

"API" is short for application programming interface, aka: "a set of rules that allows programmers to develop software for a particular operating system without having to be completely familiar with that operating system." Below you can find a list of demo APIs. To learn more about API testing, check this [API testing guide](https://abstracta.us/blog/software-testing/api-testing-guide/).

- Public-APIs

  This is a collective [list of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis/blob/master/README.md) for use in software and web development, giving you many different interfaces to practice on.

- Restful Booker

  [Restful Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) tests every single kind of CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) REST API scenarios using this example booking API.
